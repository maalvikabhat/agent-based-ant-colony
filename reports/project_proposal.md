- An agent-based model of collective nest choice by the ant Temnothorax albipennis
http://www2.math.uu.se/~david/web/PrattSumpter05.pdf
The ant Temnothorax albipennis is unique in that a group of these ants are good at collectively choosing the best nest site. When an ant finds a site, it goes through several stages of independent assessment, recruiting other ants to support its site, and bulking up the new colony via rapid transports to the site. The rules and strategy that the ants follow may results in collective decisions, despite how individual ants are responsible for assessments, by the growth rate of populations among these new sites. The authors of this paper set out to test this hypothesis with an agent-based model, where the agents abided by these rules. While the model is very complex, we hope to simulate it using a finite state machine. Additionally, we want to create a simulation of how the ants will move within the colony. 

- The ontogeny of the interaction structure in bumble bee colonies: A MIRROR model

The authors of this paper utilize a MIRROR agent-based model in order to achieve macro behavior of a beehive. The model looks at individual bee behavior by location, and from previous interactions with other bees. The model seeks to explore how beehives function and what micro behaviors could explain the beehive behavior. In addition, this model investigates the population of each individual type of bee given that each bee has a different behavior based on its role in the hive. We hope to use some of the insights from this paper in our own visualization of the ant colony.
 
### Experiment Plan

We plan to implement k-core analysis in our initial experiment to help identify small interlinked core areas on a network. Additionally, we hope to identify a specific growth mechanism. Our final report will also inculde robustness, or the average coreness of each node. We are looking to understand how much effect removing one node would have on the Wikipedia system in its entirety.

### Next Steps
Plus, we have a task board up and running under the *Projects* bar in this repository!
