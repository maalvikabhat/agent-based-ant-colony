#### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
The team is replicating a variation of the Sugarscape model that was covered in class--by adding a new component, illness, to the model. With illness being prone to spread with a higher probability in densely populated areas, the team wishes to observe whether the tendency to avoid illness or the tendency to acquire more sugar will overpower one another (or even coexist). I believe that it was a great idea to highlight the question they are trying to answer at the end of their abstract. I was a bit confused with the part of the abstract that mentions "aid" by other agents. The abstract mentions that the disease spreads to nearby agents unless significant aid is received by surrounding agents. What is the line betwen spreading an illness and receiving aid to and from surrounding agents? From what is written, aiding seems to deter the impact of the illness. If so, how is this behavior going to be explored/analyzed?

#### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
The methodology was clear to me as I am an audience who has taken Complexity Science before and therefore have implemented Sugarscape before. Considernig that, I think it would be helpful to include a high-level overview of the implementation/methodology/experiment for the general audience. Thus, I would love to see some explanation in the "aid" from other agents.

#### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
The results were clear as there was a paragraph that was dedicated to explaining the figures. I believe that once the team has the different color identification for ill agents to work, the results would convey the experiment to a great detail. It would be nice to have some caption or a label on each picture to indicate that the picture was taken at x timestep. 

#### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
Yes. It seems like there is a split of agents--those who prioritize sugar over health, and those who prioritize health over sugar (this is from the expected outcome). 

#### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?
It seems like the paper used as the primary source doesn't answer a question in the same field as the team, so the team's results would be separate from the source paper. The team's result seems qualitative as of now (observing agent behavior that arises).

#### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
Yes, the report answers an interesting question of divided priorities within agents and how that will affect agent behavior and the model.

#### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
It seems like the team is at a good stance of having the illness implemented into the model. They only seem to have the issue of tweaking the data visualization of the simulation, which looks like a reasonable amount of workload till the due date.

#### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide (Links to an external site.)?
It was easy to follow through the report. It seemed like the report contained a grammatical error in the phrase, "this behaviour immediately obvious".

#### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 
I believe that the report for this assignment should have been named as draft_report.md, not final_report_draft.md. Apart from that, the rest of the mechanics look good.
