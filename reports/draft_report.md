## Agent-Based Ant Colony's Emigration Process
#### Maalvika Bhat, Hyunkyung Rho

### Abstract
Colonies of the ant (Temnothorax Albipennis) can collectively choose the best of several nest sites, even when many of the active ants who organize the move visit only one site. Previous studies have suggested that this ability stems from the antsâ€™ strategy of graded commitment to a potential home. On finding a site, an ant proceeds from independent assessment, to recruiting fellow active ants via slow tandem runs, to bringing the passive bulk of the colony via rapid transports. Assessment duration varies inversely with site quality, and the switch from tandem runs to transports requires that a quorum of ants first be summoned to the site. These rules may generate a collective decision, by creating and amplifying differential population growth rates among sites. We have simulated the model laid out in the original paper and tested the importance of these and other known behavioural rules by incorporating them into an agent-based model. Additionaly, we have created a visualization which demonstrates how the ants move during the emigration process.
